# coffee-analysis

## Description
We are a coffee company based in Southampton, UK, and are looking to improve where we 
source our coffee from. The quality of coffee sourced from our existing suppliers has significantly
reduced in recent years, so we want to change suppliers whilst maintaining our reputation as the
best artisanal coffee place in town.
We have obtained a wealth of coffee supplier data from the independent Coffee Quality Institute,
but we lack the skills required to analyse the data to help us decide where to send our coffee 
buyers to negotiate a new supply.

## Pre-requisites

## Installation

## Usage
We have some existing code that was used in the past for previous analyses that was developed
by previous employees that left the company, and would like to build on this existing code, whilst
ensuring we're able to run the updated code ourselves in the future.
This code generates a visual plot of United States coffee suppliers in terms of flavor and cupper 
points, and can be found at https://github.com/softwaresaved/coffee-analysis. It is not currently 
documented, but can be run using the following commands:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analyse-coffee.py
