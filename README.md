# coffee-analysis

## Description

## Pre-requisites

## Installation

## Usage
We have some existing code that was used in the past for previous analyses that was developed
by previous employees that left the company, and would like to build on this existing code, whilst
ensuring we're able to run the updated code ourselves in the future.
This code generates a visual plot of United States coffee suppliers in terms of flavor and cupper 
points, and can be found at https://github.com/softwaresaved/coffee-analysis. It is not currently 
documented, but can be run using the following commands:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analyse-coffee.py
